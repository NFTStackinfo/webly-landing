heroHeading: Return on Investment with OurPetPolicy
sec1Heading: Tell us about your Properties
sec1SubHeading1: How many Units
sec1Text1: (How many residential rental units do you have with animals?)
sec1Desc: With this calculator you can input your specific data and see how much
  value OurPetPolicy could add to your residential rental portfolio.
sec2Heading: Pet Rent
sec2SubHeading1: Pet rent per month
sec2Text1: (How much do you charge, on average, per pet per month?)
sec2SubHeading2: ESA’s percentage before OurPetPolicy
sec2Text2: (What percentage of all animals in your rentals before OurPetPolicy
  are ESA’s? (Typically 50-80%))
sec2SubHeading3: Fraudulent ESA to Pet percentage
sec2Text3: (The percentage of ESA’s that are fraudulent and get turned into
  paying pet rent, typically 50-70%)
sec2Desc: Having pets in a rental can dramatically increase the wear and tear of
  your property. By charging pet rent, you are helping to offset the costs of
  these costs, every month.
sec3Heading: Pet Deposits
sec3SubHeading1: Pet Deposit
sec3Text1: (How much do you charge for each pet deposit?)
sec3SubHeading2: Average Pets per Rental
sec3Text2: (For every unit that has a pet, what is the average number of pets per unit?)
sec3Desc: When a tenant leaves and the damage from their pet is assessed to be
  hundreds of dollars more than their security deposit, most landlords
  understand that it is not worth taking them to court, where they could end up
  spending more money than they would recoup. By collecting pet deposits you
  have more money to help cover the damage left by their animals.
sec4Heading: Fees and Fines
sec4SubHeading1: Unauthorized Pet Fee
sec4Text1: (How much would you like to charge tenants for an unauthorized pet?)
sec4SubHeading2: Percentage of unauthorized pet fees
sec4Text2: (What percentage of tenants do you collect unauthorized pet fees from?)
sec4SubHeading3: Percentage of tenants that get an animal prior to approval
sec4Text3: (What percentage of tenants that get an animal, get one before it has
  been approved?)
sec4Desc: We have found that most Landlords have an Unauthorized Pet Fee but do
  not have the proper documentation to charge for the fee, which results in
  tenants taking advantage of the situation. We have also found that tenants
  will get an animal, bring the animal home, and then purchase a fraudulent ESA
  letter after the fact. Our contract and application process prevent these
  occurrences so that Landlords are not losing out on their own policies
sec5Heading: Time Savings
sec5SubHeading1: Time spent dealing with animals (in hours)
sec5Text1: (How much time on average, per tenant that has an animal, does
  property management spend giving instructions, answering questions, etc.?)
sec5SubHeading2: Property Management wage (per hour)
sec5Text2: (How much time, in dollars per hour, is the property manager’s time
  spent dealing with pet questions and pet damage?)
sec5Desc: Time is money. Communicating with tenants about waste management
  policies, issues, or how to get an animal, etc. can take a lot of a property
  manager’s time. OurPetPolicy clearly outlines these matters so that all you
  have to do is send them to ourpetpolicy.com and we will take it from there.
  Let us help you maximize your time!
