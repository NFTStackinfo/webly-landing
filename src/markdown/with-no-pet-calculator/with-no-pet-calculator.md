metaTitle: with no pet calculator
metaDescription: with no pet calculator description
heroHeading: Return on Investment with OurPetPolicy
sec1Heading: Tell us about your Properties
sec1SubHeading1: How many Units
sec1Text1: (How many residential rental units do you have with animals?)
sec1SubHeading2: What is your Average Monthly Rent
sec1Text2: (What is the overall average monthly rent of all of your units?)
sec1Desc: With this calculator you can input your specific data and see how much
  value OurPetPolicy could add to your residential rental portfolio.
sec2Heading: Cost of pet damage
sec2SubHeading1: Estimated percentage of units with Pets (%)
sec2Text1: (What percentage of units, would you estimate, have animals in them?)
sec2SubHeading2: Percentage of animals that cause damage (%)
sec2Text2: (For every unit with an animal, what percentage of them have damage
  from the animal at the end of the lease?)
sec2SubHeading3: Typical cost to fix damage from an animal
sec2Text3: (How much does it cost to fix damage from an animal, when there is
  damage, after a tenant leaves?)
sec2Desc: Did you know recent studies show that 72%-90% of tenants have an
  animal? (see links below)
sec3Heading: Lost Rent
sec3SubHeading1: Additional turn-around time (in weeks)
sec3Text1: (For a rental that has pet damage, how much longer does it take to
  fix it up until it is ready to rent again?)
sec3SubHeading2: Animal reduction percentage from using OurPetPolicy
sec3Text2: (Typically 50-70% of ESA letters are fraudulent and will be exposed
  with OurPetPolicy)
sec3SubHeading3: Average length-of-stay in months
sec3Text3: (On average, how many months do your tenants stay before moving?)
sec3Desc: With new websites popping up daily selling fraudulent ESA letters for
  as low as $39, this loophole is being abused nationwide. We have a validation
  process and typically find that 50%-70% of ESA letters are fraudulent. By
  eliminating this upfront, we can greatly reduce the number of fraudulent
  animals in your rentals, which greatly reduces damages. With less damage, you
  will have a shorter, and more cost-effective, turnaround time to rent your
  property to the next tenant.
sec4Heading: Fees and Fines
sec4SubHeading1: Unauthorized Pet Fee
sec4Text1: (How much would you like to charge tenants for an unauthorized pet?)
sec4SubHeading2: Percentage of Unauthorized Pet Fees
sec4Text2: (What percentage of tenants do you collect unauthorized pet fees from?)
sec4SubHeading3: Percentage of tenants that get an animal prior to approval
sec4Text3: (What percentage of tenants that get an animal, get one before it has
  been approved?)
sec4Desc: We have found that most Landlords have an Unauthorized Pet Fee but do
  not have the proper documentation to charge for the fee, which results in
  tenants taking advantage of the situation. We have also found that tenants
  will get an animal, bring the animal home, and then purchase a fraudulent ESA
  letter after the fact. Our contract and application process prevent these
  occurrences so that Landlords are not losing out on their own policies
sec5Heading: Time Savings
sec5SubHeading1: Time spent dealing with animals (in hours)
sec5Text1: (How much time on average, per tenant that has an animal, does
  property management spend giving instructions, answering questions, etc.?)
sec5SubHeading2: Time spent dealing with animal damage
sec5Text2: (How much time does it take, on average, to line up contractors, etc.
  to repair animal damages and get a rental ready to rent again?)
sec5SubHeading3: Property Management wage (per hour)
sec5Text3: (How much time, in dollars per hour, is the property manager’s time
  spent dealing with pet questions and pet damage?)
sec5Desc: Time is money. Communicating with tenants about waste management
  policies, issues, or how to get an animal, etc. can take a lot of a property
  manager’s time. OurPetPolicy clearly outlines these matters so that all you
  have to do is send them to ourpetpolicy.com and we will take it from there.
  Let us help you maximize your time!
sec6Heading: Summary
sec6Desc: Our goal is to put more money in your pocket while protecting your rentals.
